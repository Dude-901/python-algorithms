# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please make sure that the changes you wish to make consists of an algorithm/concept/adanced DSA implementation 
and not a mere program which almost everyone beginning with python knows(like even/odd check).  

However Basic programs are welcomed in another repository of ours to get your journey of Open source contribution 
started without the need of in-depth knowledge of programming. if someone is at the beginning to learn programming, you can contribute in  
our [Basic programs](https://github.com/Dude-901/basic-programs) repository.

## Pull Request Process

* Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a

## Code of Conduct
Please make sure that the approach/algorithm/concept whose implementation you are adding is completely your work, not 
copy-pasted from somewhere, or adding someone else's work.
